### Understanding LSTM Networks 
 
 The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that aims to rectify the problems of standard RNNs where it is difficult to learn long term dependencies of the sequence data. That is why LSTM networks are the best suited for calculations where context and memory are considered as significant: as it was mentioned, time series forecasting, speech recognition, and natural language processing (NLP). 
 
 #### Why LSTMs? 
 
 RNNs are particularly effective when used for organizing data in sequence form but they fail at preserving information in long sequences because of the vanishing gradient difficulty. This issue results to the network forgetting the earlier inputs as the sequence advances making it even hard for the model to master dependencies over time intervals. 
 
 LSTMs solve this by incorporating a better structure that involves having a memory cell used to preserve data for some time. The key components of LSTMs include:

 1. **Cell State**: We use it to store information from earlier time step and transport it to the later time steps. Thus it helps the network to keep context, and knowing that certain information is anyhow relevant or important. 
 
 2. **Gates**: LSTMs have a total of 3 gates in them that determines the flow of information. 
 - **Forget Gate**: Determines, which information from cell state it is better to ignore. 
 - **Input Gate**: Decides which new information to store in the cell state . 
 - **Output Gate**: Regulates the information that get transferred between the subsequent hidden state. 
 
 These gates help LSTMs to provide proper guidance for remembering and forgetting information which helps in the effective capturing of long-term dependencies. 
 
 #### Applications of LSTM Networks 
 
 LSTM networks are widely used in various applications, including:LSTM networks are widely used in various applications, including: 
 - **Time Series Forecasting**: Casting characterizations on existing patterns so as to forecast future values for instances like stock prates or weather conditions. 
 - **Speech Recognition**: Transforming the spoken words into written format with the help of signals received from the sound input. 
 - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: The processes such as sentiment analysis, machine translation and auto-generation of text. 
 
 #### Conclusion 
 
 LSTMs are useful tools when it comes to sequence modelling as they offer both the learning and memory capacity. Due to their construction, they are able to avoid the drawbacks of the standard RNNs which make them suitable in many applications with long-term dependencies. Therefore, LSTM networks are widely used nowadays in the deep learning for sequential data.
